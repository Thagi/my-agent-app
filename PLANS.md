# Implementation Plan

## 1. Bootstrap the Repository
- [x] Create a `podman-compose.yml` that defines services for LibreChat, LangGraph agent service, n8n, Ollama, and shared infrastructure (e.g., Redis/PostgreSQL if required by LibreChat or the agent).
- [x] Configure named volumes and host bind mounts under `./volumes/` for LibreChat data, LangGraph state, n8n configuration, Ollama models, and MCP assets.
- [x] Provide sample environment files (`.env.example`, `services/langgraph/.env.example`) that document required secrets and defaults.

- [x] Scaffold a Python package under `services/langgraph/` using `poetry` or `uv` for dependency management.
- [x] Implement core graph nodes:
  - [x] **Input parsing** node to normalize LibreChat requests.
  - [x] **Planner** node that selects tools and models.
  - [x] **Executor** node that interacts with MCP servers and handles streaming responses.
  - [x] **Validator** node to confirm task completion or trigger replanning.
- [x] Add a model router that supports OpenAI, Ollama, and pluggable providers via configuration.
- [x] Expose an HTTP API compatible with LibreChat expectations (likely OpenAI-compatible endpoints).

## 3. MCP Integration Layer
- [x] Define a registry format (YAML/JSON) for MCP server metadata stored under `mcp/registry/`.
- [ ] Implement automatic discovery for:
  - [ ] Static MCP servers declared in configuration.
  - [ ] n8n workflows exported as MCP descriptors.
- [ ] Add health checks and connection pooling to maintain reliable communication with remote MCP servers.
- [ ] Validate registry schemas at startup and surface actionable diagnostics in the agent logs.
- [ ] Implement hot-reload or cache invalidation for registry updates without restarting the service.

## 4. n8n Workflow Packaging
- Create a guideline for authoring workflows with clear input/output contracts.
- Provide example workflows (e.g., web search, data enrichment) and scripts to export them as MCP-compatible modules.
- Implement a lightweight adapter service, if necessary, to translate between n8n webhook executions and MCP protocol expectations.

## 5. LibreChat Integration
- Configure LibreChat to authenticate against the LangGraph agent HTTP API using environment variables defined in the compose file.
- Customize LibreChat prompts or system messages to guide users in invoking available tools.
- Document instructions for adding new UI features or enabling multi-agent rooms if required.

## 6. Observability & Operations
- Add logging and metrics aggregation (e.g., OpenTelemetry) to the LangGraph service.
- Emit provider-level metrics (latency, error counts) so routing heuristics can be tuned over time.
- Provide dashboards or scripts for monitoring container health and MCP usage.
- Document backup and restore procedures for persistent volumes.

## 7. Continuous Integration
- Set up GitHub Actions (or equivalent) to lint Python code, validate compose files, and run smoke tests against the agent API.
- Include automated checks that ensure documentation (README, PLANS) stays synchronized with the compose definitions.

## 8. Future Enhancements
- Explore fine-tuned or specialized models for domain-specific tasks.
- Add role-based access control to LibreChat and n8n.
- Enable automated deployment scripts targeting container orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, Nomad) in addition to Podman Compose.
